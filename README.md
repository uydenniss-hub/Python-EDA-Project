# Python EDA Project

This project demonstrates **end-to-end exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on product sales data.  
It covers data ingestion, cleaning, visualization, and reporting to uncover key trends and insights.

## Project Structure
- `notebook.ipynb` — main Jupyter notebook with step-by-step analysis.
- `product_sales.csv` — sample dataset used in this project.
- `reports/Practical-+DAP+-+Product+Sales.pdf` — polished report summarizing findings.
- `figures/` — exported graphs and visualizations.
- `requirements.txt` — list of Python dependencies for reproducibility.

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing with **pandas**.  
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) with **NumPy** and **matplotlib/seaborn**.  
- Graphs showing customer behavior, revenue distribution, and sales method performance.  
- Written report summarizing insights and methodology.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
